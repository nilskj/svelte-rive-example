# Svelte Rive Example

This is an example of how one could implement [Rive Animations](https://rive.app/) in a Svelte app

In this app we use the [Rive WASM runtime](https://github.com/rive-app/rive-wasm) in order to do some more customized animation.
As en example we mix all specified animations and can scrub the playhead and bind it to the window scroll.

Example animation [Flame and Spark by JcToon](https://rive.app/community/186-341-flame-and-spark/)
